\title{Zernike polynomials and cartesian gradients}
\usage{
gradzpm_cart(x, y, maxorder = 12L, unit_variance = FALSE, return_zpm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of x coordinates for points on a unit disk.}

\item{y}{a vector of y coordinates.}

\item{maxorder}{the maximum radial polynomial order (defaults to 12).}

\item{unit_variance}{logical: return with orthonormal scaling? (default \code{false})}

\item{return_zpm}{logical: return Zernike polynomial matrix? (default \code{true})}
}
\value{
a named list with the matrices \code{zm} (optional but returned by default), \code{dzdx}, \code{dzdy}.
}
\description{
Calculate Zernike polynomial values and Cartesian gradients in
ISO/ANSI sequence for a set of Cartesian coordinates.
}
\details{
Uses the recurrence relations in the above publication to calculate Zernike
polynomial values and their directional derivatives in Cartesian coordinates. These are
known to be both efficient and numerically stable.

Columns are in ISO/ANSI sequence: for each radial order n >= 0 the azimuthal orders m are sequenced
m = {-n, -(n-2), ..., (n-2), n}, with sine components for negative m and cosine for positive m. Note this
is the opposite ordering from the extended Fringe set and the ordering of aberrations is quite different.
For example the two components of trefoil are in the 7th and 10th column while coma is in
columns 8 and 9 (or 7 and 8 with 0-indexing). Note also that except for tilt and coma-like aberrations
(m=1) non-axisymmetric aberrations will be separated.

All three matrices will have the same dimensions on return. Columns 0 and 1 of \code{dzdx} will be all 0,
while columns 0 and 2 of \code{dzdy} are 0.

\examples{
 rho <- seq(0.2, 1., length=5)
 theta <- seq(0, 1.6*pi, length=5)
 rt <- expand.grid(theta, rho)
 x <- c(0, rt[,2]*cos(rt[,1]))
 y <- c(0, rt[,2]*sin(rt[,1]))
 gzpm <- gradzpm_cart(x, y)

\code{\link[=zpm]{zpm()}} uses the same recurrence relations for polar coordinates and extended
Fringe set ordering, which is the more common indexing scheme for optical design/testing
software.

\code{\link[=zpm_cart]{zpm_cart()}} calculates and returns the Zernike polynomial values only.
